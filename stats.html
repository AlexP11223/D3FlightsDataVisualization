    <h3>Seasonality</h3>

    <p>
        There is a huge drop of activity on Saturdays, probably related to business trips.
    </p>
    <p>
        Also it seems like there are more flights in the summer (especially July-August), probably because of holidays,
        as well as some increases in the beginning of Spring (Easter, Spring break?),
        and the least active period is from middle of January to middle of February.
